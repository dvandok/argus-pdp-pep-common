# TODO: figure out why the following is necessary. It seems that
# running a pbuilder build ends up at dpkg-source --after-build and
# wants to undo the quilt patches, while the pom.xml is still in the
# state that mh_patchpoms left it in. Naturally, the patch on the original
# pom.xml cannot be undone at that time, so as a (temporary) fix I've added
# this rule to do mh_unpatchpoms manually. Could be a bug in the Debian Maven
#repo helpers.
